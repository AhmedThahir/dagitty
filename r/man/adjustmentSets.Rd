\usage{
adjustmentSets(x, exposure = NULL, outcome = NULL, effect = "total")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the input graph.}

\item{exposure}{name(s) of the exposure variable(s). If not given (default), then the 
exposure variables are supposed to be defined in the graph itself.}

\item{outcome}{name(s) of the outcome variable(s), also taken from the graph if 
not given.}

\item{effect}{which effect is to be identified. If \code{effect="total"}, then the
total effect is to be identified, and the adjustment criterion by van der Zander et 
al (2014), an extension of Pearl's back-door criterion, is used. Otherwise, if 
\code{effect="direct"}, then the average direct effect is to be identified, and Pearl's
single-door criterion is used (Pearl, 2009). In a structural equation model (Gaussian
graphical model), direct effects are simply the path coefficients.}

\description{
Enumerates sets of covariates that (asymptotically) allow unbiased estimation of causal
effects from observational data, assuming that the input causal graph is correct.

\examples{
# The M-bias graph showing that adjustment for 
# pre-treatment covariates is not always valid
g <- dagitty( "dag{ x -> y ; x <-> m <-> y }" )
adjustmentSets( g, "x", "y" ) # empty set
# Generate data where true effect (=path coefficient) is .5
set.seed( 123 ); d <- simulateSEM( g, .5, .5 )
confint( lm( y ~ x, d ) )["x",] # includes .5
confint( lm( y ~ x + m, d ) )["x",] # does not include .5
